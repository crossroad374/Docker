Multi-stage Dockerfile syntax allows you to build a Docker image using multiple stages, where each stage represents a separate build environment. This feature is particularly useful for optimizing the size of your Docker images and separating build dependencies from the final production image.

sample Template

# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM base_image AS build_stage

# Install dependencies and build application
RUN some_command_to_install_dependencies
RUN some_command_to_build_application

# Stage 2: Production stage
FROM another_base_image AS production_stage

# Copy artifacts from the build stage
COPY --from=build_stage /path/to/artifacts /destination/path

# Additional configuration or steps for the production image
RUN additional_commands_if_needed

# Specify the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["/path/to/startup/script"]
